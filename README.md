# PyOpenGL Studies

A simple repository for all the codes I wrote while studying PyOpenGL (whether using FreeGLUT or GLFW). For the FreeGLUT version it will be necessary to have it installed for your current OS, in Ubuntu you can install it from the freeglut3-dev package or by conda:

```bash
    sudo apt install freeglut3-dev
    # conda install -c conda-forge freeglut
```

**For the GLFW variant the requirements.txt should cover**
